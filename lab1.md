In lecture this week, we learned about the commands **cd**, **ls** and **cat**.

They can provide you ease of access to specific files and directories. 

## I will use the lecture1 directory for this lab report.

Here are examples of me using the commands with *no* arguments provided:

```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ ls
lecture1
[user@sahara ~]$ cat
```
Without using a specific argument, **cd** will not know which directory to change to.

As such, no change in which file directory we are in happens.

The **ls** command only lists out the name of the current directory, lecture1
