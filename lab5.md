## Part 1: Debugging Scenario

Below is a *simulation* of what an EdStem post on a debugging scenario would look like. Firstly, a student publishes a question on EdStem, after of course looking through similar posts and seeing if the question has already been answered. 

1. After confirming that there are apparently **no** related posts, the student posts the following question below:

2. A TA graciously responds to the question that the student posts, by providing the following insight to the student:

3. By following the TA's instructions on how to resolve the bug, the student showcases the following output:

4. In the end, the student received feedback that helped them with identifying what was the **bug** that causes the **behavior** in their code. They were able to identify the following:

- The location of the working file and directory:

- The contents of each of the relevant files **before** they fixed the bug:

- The set of necessary commands for them to run to induce the bug:

- The steps needed to be taken to resolve the bug:


By working cooperatively with the TA, and by giving themself some grace to sit down and work through the tedious process of resolving a coding bug, the student was now able to resolve their issue, which received an "answered" checkmark on EdStem.

## Part 2: Reflection

I think one of the most intriguing things I learned about towards the end of this class was the `vim` text editor. The `vim` command was very interesting to me not only because I was able to learn a nifty set of tricks and commands to navigate through my code much more efficiently, but also because what I found out about it beyond the scope of just the labs and lectures. 

I considered that because `vim` functions as a text editor, I would be able to obviously edit the text and composition of my code files. Additionally, I also saw that there are various plugins that I could use to further enhance my `vim` experience. Such plugins include `vim-taskwarrior`, which as the name implies, will allow you to become a much more proficient task manager. You can create a list of tasks additionaly with the options of adding dates, tags, dependencies, etc. Although I haven't really developed many skills in `vim` just yet, I do see myself using such a tool to help with planning any major projects, and furthermore executing them with an organized workflow. 

Another useful tool I found associated with `vim` was `Syntastic`. (I'm noticing the creators of these plugins have fun with the titles). It is a plugin that helps with identifying any potential issues, such as syntax bugs, in your code. It does so on a line-by-line basis, wherein as the user navigates through their files in `vim`, they will be confronted with an error message related to syntax in the command window. It will even display error pop-up messages over the line that contains the error when you hover your mouse over it. All in all, it can help simplify the process of identifying error-inducing inputs that commonly requires the use of `vim` to fix. By now knowing that these various plugins exist, I can see how the normally very daunting process of revising code can become a litle bit easier to tackle.
